description:    YulDSL provides an EDSL called 'YulDSL' for transpiling Haskell code to Solidiy/Yul code.

                Additionally, the package uses a technique called "evaluating linear functions to symmetric monoidal
                categories (Jean-Philippe Bernardy and Arnaud Spiwack)" to provide an ergonomic linear functions
                (nicknamed "lolipop" functions, hence the project name) programming environment for the 'YulDSL'.

                Furthermore, the 'YulDSL' has its portable artifact form (WORK-IN-PROGRESS), which opens the door for
                other frontends (a visual programming interface or other principled programming languages) to produce
                and share 'YulDSL' as portable modules with each other.
