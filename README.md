Yolc - A Safe, Expressive, Fun Language for Ethereum
====================================================

The main motivation behind Yolc is to strike a balance between these values for building Ethereum smart contracts:

*Safe*

Yolc is purely functional with linear type safety, made for the Ethereum virtual machine.

> What does *purely functional linear type safety* mean here? Read more [here](#).

*Expressive*

YulDSL provides an EDSL called 'YulDSL' for transpiling Haskell code to Solidiy/Yul code.

> Why does *expressiveness* matter? Read more [here](#).

*Fun*

Yolc allows you to write safe code in production, a joyful experience for super coders.

> Check out these [example codes](#).

> [!TIP]
>
> Yolc is a compiler program for "YulDSL/Haskell". YulDSL is a domain-specific language (DSL) based on [category
> theory](https://category-theory.org/) for [Solidity/Yul](https://soliditylang.org/). YulDSL can be embedded in
> different languages, with "YulDSL/Haskell" being the first of its kind. Curiously, the name "yolc" sounds similar to
> "solc", the compiler program for "Solidity/Yul".
>
> Do not worry if you don't understand some of these concepts, you can start with Yolc right away and have a rewarding,
> fun experience writing safer production smart contracts. However, if you do feel adventurous and want to delve into
> the inner workings of YulDSL, read [here](./hs-pkgs/yul-dsl/README.md).

> [!CAUTION]
>
> ðŸš§ While this project is still work in progress ðŸš§, the good news is after pausing for the good part of 2024 due to
> business reason, I am back to it. As of 2024 October, the end-to-end is working and I have adjusted the roadmap and
> planned an exciting type system for the first release!
>
> Contact me at info@yolc.dev if you are interested in testing this project out soon!
